# General approaches to tackle problems

## Search the exception
See if you can find related discussion from google, StackOverflow, Pytorch discussion forum, etc.

## Find source code of related problems
See if you can get some insights from the source code to understand the problem.

## Narrow down the problem
### Binary search
Binary search is generally a very good way of approaching problems. Try to gradually narrow down which part of the code is causing the issue. Once you get to the exact part of the culprit code, you may get better sense of what the problem is and where to investigate more.
### Try to reproduce the problem with minimal code
This is similar to above, and will help you understand which part of the code is causing issues.
